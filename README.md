# Spike_bluetooth_test
Simple test for Spike Prime Bluetooth interface
Just download hub.py to a spike prime hub and run pi.py after coupling both devices as shown in this tutorial https://medium.com/jj-innovative-results/how-to-set-up-bluetooth-on-the-raspberry-pi-for-a-lego-spike-61b137f98673 .
You can also transmit the SW via Bluetooth to the Prime Hub with this Spiketools https://github.com/nutki/spike-tools and the corresponding VSCode Addon https://github.com/sanjayseshan/spikeprime-vscode
